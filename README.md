# miRNAs-mRNAs-in-ECs-after-malaria_Thesis
Supplementary material, analysis code, and data for the thesis on endothelial response to P. falciparum 
# Supplementary Data for Thesis

This repository contains the supplementary datasets and analysis code associated with my PhD thesis:  
**miRNAs and mRNAs in endothelial cells after malaria infection**.

All data are provided as Excel or CSV files. Large datasets that could not be included in the thesis PDF are deposited here for transparency and reproducibility.

## Repository Structure

- `DEGs_DEmiRNAs/` â†’ Differential expression results (Supplementary Tables 1â€“).  
  - Contains complete lists of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and miRNAs (DE miRNAs) in endothelial cells and extracellular vesicles (EVs) under different experimental conditions.  
- `GO_KEGG_enrichment/` â†’ Functional enrichment results.  
  - Includes Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway enrichment outputs for DEGs and predicted miRNA targets.  
- `TargetPrediction/` â†’ Predicted miRNAâ€“mRNA interactions.  
  - Results from multiMiR and other tools used for miRNA target prediction.  
- `Cytokines/` â†’ Multiplex cytokine secretion profiles.  
- `VarGenes/` â†’ Var gene expression profiles in *P. falciparum* isolates.  
- `code/` â†’ R scripts and analysis pipelines for differential expression, enrichment analysis, and data visualization.
